Tell me, does it look like in heaven?what 
Is it peaceful? Is it free like they say?
Does the sun shine bright forever?
Have your fears and your pain gone away?
'Cause here on Earth it feels like everything
Good is missing since you left
And here on Earth, everything's different
There's an emptiness
vim-oh, I
I hope you're dancing in the sky
And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir
And I hope the angels know what they have
I'll bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived
So tell me, what do you do up in Heaven?
Are your days filled with love and light?
Is there music? Is there art and adventure?
Tell me are you happy? Are you more alive?
'Cause here on Earth it feels like everything
Good is missing since you left
And here on Earth everything's different
There's an emptiness
vim-oh, I
I hope you're dancing in the sky
And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir
And I hope the angels know what they have
I'll bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived
vim-oh, I
I hope you're dancing in the sky
And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir
And I hope the angels know what they have

I hope you're dancing in the sky
And I hope you're singing in the angel's choir
And I hope the angels know what they have
